								To further advance <a href=ev_adopt.html>electric vehicle (EV) adoption</a>, some reports and individuals underscore the pivotal role of EV infrastructure. 
								Beyond economic considerations and battery condition, the development of a thorough EV charging station network is a critical aspect. 
								Aligned with the GHG reduction strategies outlined in PlaNYC, 
								the government has established a goal to ensure that every New Yorker is no more than 2.5 miles from an EV fast charging hub by 2025. 
							</p>

							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								It's important to recognize the symbiotic relationship between EV adoption and infrastructure development. 
								As more individuals embrace EVs, the demand for charging stations increases, driving the expansion of charging infrastructure. 
								Simultaneously, a widespread infrastructure system fosters greater consumer confidence and willingness to invest in EVs.

									2030 National Charging Network Report
								</a> from NREL, researchers describe the entire network as a tree. 
								Private charging, including charging at home and workplace, constitutes the invisible roots of the network. 
								As the foundation of the network tree, it is estimated to require half (52%) of the national investment to achieve accessibility by 2030. 
								Apart from private charging, the visible components of the tree belong to public charging. 
								A reliable public fast charging network serves as the trunk to enhance the network accessibility. 
								Given its high costs for utility upgrades and power procurement, an estimated 39% of the investment will be allocated to fast charging. 
								The final component of the system is public destination charging, resembling branches that flourish in dense neighborhoods. 
								The growth of public destination charging relies on support from charging infrastructure elsewhere. 
								Approximately 9% of the investment will be directed towards these branches. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								Based on the assumption of mid-adoption (33 million PEVs), 
								the simulated 2030 network estimates that <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue; color: beige;">3 ports/100 PEVs</mark> will be accessible at private multi-family homes and workplaces, 
								<mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue; color: beige;">1.5 ports/100 PEVs</mark> at public Level 2, 
								and <mark style="background-color: cornflowerblue; color: beige;">0.6 ports/100 PEVs</mark> at public DC charging nationally.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">

							<h5 class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16; font-weight: 600;">Private Charging: Home charging is essential</h5>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Quantity</strong>: As the dataset only displays non-residential stations, 
								we are unable to fully assess the station of home charging. 
								Apart from the residential charging, there are 37 station locations recorded.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Location</strong>: In early 2024, Hilltop Village Co-op in Queens installed the largest residential EV charging stations in NYC. 
								Granted by Con Edison and NYSERDA, there are 423 chargers across the garages and outdoor parking lots. 
								Undoubtedly, it set an example for future construction in multi-unit dwellings. 
								Besides home charging, some are located at workplaces in office building (Verizon, Spectrum) and on college campus (Fordham), 
								while others belong to commercial and government fleets such as DHL, U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and New York City Police Academy.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Cost</strong>: Home charging is pivotal within the charging network as electric vehicles tend to remain parked overnight. 
								While it might be easier for single-family households, investments are needed to ensure network access for renters, 
								multi-unit dwellings (apartments), and single-family homes without off-street parking access. 
								Based on cost assumptions, the installation cost per port is $100 - $1000 for Level 1 residential charging and $500 - $1700 for Level 2 residential charging. 
								Affordability in charging and an efficient installation process, especially in multi-unit dwellings, can better promote the home charging network. 
								Workplace charging could provide a valuable benefit for employees and enhance awareness of alternative energy sources. 
								Based on EVSE cost report in 2015, Level 2 at workplace sites costs $2,704 per port and $3,842 per EVSE on average.

							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Quantity</strong>: Even though 39% of the network investment flows into DC fast charging, 
								it is estimated to constitute a relatively small portion of the total number of stations. 
								So far, 43 DCFC stations have been counted, with 12 of them being Tesla Superchargers.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Location</strong>: Since fast charging primarily targets long-distance trips and fleets, 
								these stations are predominantly situated along main traffic corridors to facilitate efficient refueling during short breaks. 
								However, charging stations within communities are crucial as well since they enable future growth with a convenient system. 
								In NYC, three current charging sites operated by Revel stand out in the dataset with their significant number of ports: 
								Bedford-Stuyvesant (25 ports), Long Island City (14 ports), and South Williamsburg (15 ports). 
								Additionally, more than half of Tesla Superchargers are constructed with more than 10 ports, 
								with most of them located near or within shopping centers.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Cost</strong>: According to collected studies in the report, 
								150-kW DC chargers cost around $45,800 to $94,000 
								while DC chargers with power ratings of 350+ kW require an investment of $63,700 to $117,900 for each port installation. 
								This costly investment is attributed to the increased labor and advanced materials required for construction.

								<strong>Quantity</strong>: Similar to tree branches, 
								public destination charging further expands the network to cater to drivers' daily activities, with each "leaf" (station) contributing to reducing charging congestion. 
								There are 634 public Level 2 charging stations counted, with 318 of them being Tesla Destination. 
								Regarding charging companies, aside from Tesla, ChargePoint Network, Blink Network, LIVINGSTON, and FLO constitute the top five in terms of Level 2 station quantity. 
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Location</strong>: The research indicate that the Level 2 average hourly utilization rate peaks in the late morning. 
								Positioned in dense neighborhoods, public Level 2 stations meet the demand for non-residential access for both occasionally long-duration activities and frequent short-duration convenient charging. 
								Most Level 2 stations in NYC are clustered in Manhattan, downtown Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and Long Island City. 
								Stations constructed by charging companies are often located in pay parking garages to ensure profitability. 
								Stations built by FLO are operated by the NYC DOT and are typically placed curbside with relative low or no entry fees for parking. 
								Generally, municipally-operated charging stations try to exclude the Central Business District (south of 60th in Manhattan) in line with the congestion pricing regulations. 
								Some of them are situated at or near hotspot areas such as medical facilities, recreational facilities.
							</p>
							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								<strong>Cost</strong>: The installation costs for each port range from $2,200 to $6,000 approximately.

							<p class="card-text" style="color: #0e0b16;">
								A sustainable and equitable investment strategy in electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is critical to facilitate the EV transition. 
								<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/environmentaljustice/justice40/" target="_blank" class="alink" style="color: cornflowerblue; font-size: 16px;">The Justice40 Initiative</a> from the federal government states that 
								<i>40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities (DACs)</i>. 
								EVSE has been deployed in well-resourced communities with many early adapters to meet EV drivers' demands. 
								However, DACs often lack clean and reliable transportation, resulting in a high transportation energy burden. 
								To prioritize the benefits of these underserved communities, the researchers from the Argonne National Laboratory elaborated 
								on the methodology to measures underserved census tracts in the study 
								<i>Using Mapping Tools to Prioritize Electric Vehicle Charger Benefits to Underserved Communities</i>. 
								In this section, 4 scenarios in terms of community charging are conducted to identify EEJ underserved communities in New York City. 
								Even though mapping data layers are effective, how to locate EVSE in a specific place in the neighborhood requires stakeholder engagement at all times.

								Using the TomTom Route API, the number of reachable ports at the census tract level is calculated based on defined population centroid. 
								Within a 15-minute driving distance, most blocks have access to more than 50 public EVSE ports, while southeastern Brooklyn lacks sufficient accessibility to ports. 
								For calculation within 15-minute walking distance, it is obvious that aside from high-density areas in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island City, 
								most neighborhoods are insufficient in walking-friendly ports.

								Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) could be considered a summarization of "underserved communities",

								In this case, DACs in the Bronx and East Brooklyn need more walkable ports to prioritize the benefits of those communities.

							High density in multi-family homes and rental housing follows the similar patterns, except in Manhattan. 
							EV drivers who live in those areas need a place for affordable long-time charging if they are unable to access private charging. 
							Residents from Bronx and some areas of Brooklyn (identified as low-income areas in B2) need more accessible public Level 2 ports for overnight charging.
